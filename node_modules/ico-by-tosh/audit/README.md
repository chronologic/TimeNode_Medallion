## Summary

TODO

<br />

### Crowdsale Contract

* Funds contributed during the crowdsale are immediately transferred to the multisig wallet
* If the minimum funding goal is not met, contributed funds must be transferred back into the crowdsale contract for investors
  to be able to withdraw their refunds

<br />

### Finalizer Contract

* *WARNING* - The *BonusFinalizeAgent* must be correctly set for the crowdsale contract before the crowdsale contracts
  `finalize()` function can be called, or the crowdsale will never be finalised correctly.

<br />

### Token Contract

The token contract is [ERC20](https://github.com/ethereum/eips/issues/20) compliant with the following features:

* `decimals` is correctly defined as `uint8` instead of `uint256`
* `transfer(...)` and `transferFrom(...)` will throw an error instead of return true/false when the transfer is invalid
* `transfer(...)` and `transferFrom(...)` have not been built with a check on the size of the data being passed. This check is
  [no longer a recommended feature](https://blog.coinfabrik.com/smart-contract-short-address-attack-mitigation-failure/)
* `approve(...)` has the [requirement that a non-zero approval limit be set to 0 before a new non-zero limit can be set](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729)

## Recommendations

* **HIGH IMPORTANCE** - In *DayToken*, `balances[_to] = safeAdd(balances[msg.sender], _value);` in `transfer(...)` should be
  `balances[_to] = safeAdd(balances[to], _value); `
  * [x] Fixed in [fd679446](https://github.com/chronologic/chronologic/commit/fd679446f01c2d29b02856719548d6a35e8c34c8)
* **MEDIUM IMPORTANCE** - In *DayToken* and *Crowdsale*, please convert the magic numbers like `333`, `3227`, `3227`, `3245` into
  constant variable that will explain the meaning of these numbers
  * [x] Fixed in [be2bbba9](https://github.com/chronologic/chronologic/commit/be2bbba97ba1c78206d2a21724f6e0b94c9afd93)
* **LOW IMPORTANCE** - In *DayToken*, `minBalanceToSell`, `crowdsaleAddress` and `BonusFinalizeAgentAddress` should be made public to
  provide visibility
  * [x] Fixed for `minBalanceToSell` in [fd679446](https://github.com/chronologic/chronologic/commit/fd679446f01c2d29b02856719548d6a35e8c34c8)
* **LOW IMPORTANCE** - In *DayToken*, `DayInSecs` should be renamed `dayInSecs` and `BonusFinalizeAgentAddress` should be renamed
  `bonusFinalizeAgentAddress` for variable naming consistency
  * [x] Fixed for `bonusFinalizeAgentAddress` in [be2bbba9](https://github.com/chronologic/chronologic/commit/be2bbba97ba1c78206d2a21724f6e0b94c9afd93)
* **LOW IMPORTANCE** - In *DayToken*, `modifier onlyCrowdsale()` is unused and can be removed to simplify the contract
  * [x] Fixed in [be2bbba9](https://github.com/chronologic/chronologic/commit/be2bbba97ba1c78206d2a21724f6e0b94c9afd93)
* **LOW IMPORTANCE** - Un-indent `function transferFrom(...)` in *DayToken*
  * [x] Fixed in [fd679446](https://github.com/chronologic/chronologic/commit/fd679446f01c2d29b02856719548d6a35e8c34c8)
* **LOW IMPORTANCE** - In *Crowdsale*, `preMinWei`, `preMaxWei`, `minWei` and `maxWei` should be made public to provide visibility
* **LOW IMPORTANCE** - In *AddressCappedCrowdsale*, `maxIcoAddresses` is never used
  * [x] Fixed in [fd679446](https://github.com/chronologic/chronologic/commit/fd679446f01c2d29b02856719548d6a35e8c34c8)
* **LOW IMPORTANCE** - In *DayToken*, `isValidContributorId(...)` and `isValidContributorAddress(...)` should be made constant
* **LOW IMPORTANCE** - Remove `DayToken.updateAllBalances()`. After enquiring about the potentially large gas cost of executing
  this function, the developers have stated that this function is not required any more, as balances are now calculated on the fly
  and this function is now disabled by default, using the switch `updateAllBalancesEnabled`
* **LOW/MEDIUM? IMPORTANCE** `totalSupply` (504,011) does not match up with the total token balances from the accounts (504,000)

      token.totalSupply=504011.000000000008064

  The reason for this is that I deployed the *DayToken* with an `_initialSupply` of 11 and these 11 tokens should have been 
  assigned to the contract owner account 0xa11a . This issue will be of **LOW IMPORTANCE** if this contract will only be
  deployed with an `_initialSupply` of 0.

  This issue may be fixed by the next issue.

* **HIGH IMPORTANCE** `DayToken.balanceOf(...)` does not work as expected for non-minting addresses. If DAY tokens are transferred
  from a minting address to a non-minting address, the non-minting address is not registered in the `DayToken.contributors` data
  structure.

  Following is the `DayToken.balanceOf(...)` function:

      function balanceOf(address _adr) public constant returns (uint256 balance) {
          return balanceById(idOf[_adr]);   
      }

  And following is the `DayToken.balanceById(...)` function:

      function balanceById(uint _id) public constant returns (uint256 balance) {
          address adr = contributors[_id].adr; 
          if (isDayTokenActivated()) {
              if (isValidContributorId(_id)) {
                  return ( availableBalanceOf(_id) );
              }
          }
          return balances[adr]; 
      }

  As the non-minting address is not registered in the `DayToken.contributors` data structure, `adr` will be set to `0x0`. The
  balance of any non-minting address will therefore always be 0.
  
  A suggested fix follows:
  
      function balanceOf(address _adr) public constant returns (uint256 balance) {
          return balanceById(idOf[_adr], _adr);   
      }
      
      function balanceById(uint _id, address a) public constant returns (uint256 balance) {
          address adr = contributors[_id].adr;
          // BK TEST
          if (adr == 0x0)
            adr = a; 
          if (isDayTokenActivated()) {
              if (isValidContributorId(_id)) {
                  return ( availableBalanceOf(_id) );
              }
          }
          return balances[adr]; 
      }

* **LOW IMPORTANCE** `DayToken.isTeamLockInPeriodOverIfTeamAddress(...)` can be set as a constant function
* **LOW IMPORTANCE** `DayToken.isValidContributorId(...)` can be set as a constant function
* **LOW IMPORTANCE** `DayToken.isValidContributorAddress(...)` can be set as a constant function
