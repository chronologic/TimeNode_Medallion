# TimeNode Medallion

The TimeNode Medallion is an on-chain solution using the ERC721 standard to the problem of proving unique ownership of 333 Day Tokens for use of the DApp. 

## How does this work?

The idea is that the owner of the Day Tokens will "stake" their 333 Day Tokens into the contract and generate a "TimeNode Medallion" NFT. The TimeNode Medallion is required to be in the possession of any TimeNode that is running through the DApp. The TimeNode Medallion is transfelable in order to allow for a market to evolve around it, if demand occurs. When a TimeNode Medallion is destroyed, it is burned forever and the Day Tokens are returned to the staking address.
